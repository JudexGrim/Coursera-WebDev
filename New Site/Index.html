                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Omar Akram al-Jumaili from Iraq. I hold a bachelor's degree
                    in Pharmacy from the University of Jordan and am currently pursuing a
                    career in web development. With a passion for learning and a commitment
                    to excellence, I'm excited to blend my diverse background in healthcare
                    with the creative and technical world of web development.
                </p>

            <span class="Education">
                <p>
                    With a Bachelorette in Pharmacy from the University of Jordan, I’ve developed
                    strong skills in research, analysis, and problem-solving. My experience in the pharmaceutical
                    field taught me the importance of precision and detail, which I now bring into my work as I
                    transition into web development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m currently focused on building my technical skills, eager to create user-friendly digital
                    solutions. My goal is to combine what I’ve learned in healthcare with new web development
                    expertise to make meaningful contributions in this field.
                </p>
